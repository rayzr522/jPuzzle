> Another "game" from my early education in the wonderful world of code

I hesitate to say game since in reality this is simply a character who can move around in a 16x16 grid of various kinds of tiles. However, at the time, it was an achievement for me, since I actually wrote this before my first true game, [Astra](https://github.com/Rayzr522/Astra). However, as I mentioned, this is hardly a game. There is no score, there is no goal, there is no way to win or lose.

The controls are simple, just the arrow keys to move around, `R` to reset, and `ESC` to exit. You can walk around on the grass, use the staircases to get up onto the walls and boxes, and if you're on ground-level (grass), you can push the boxes around.

_Fun little tip: you can actually take the boxes and make a bridge from one little section of wall to another and uses the staircases to get up to it!_

## Installation

Just grab the latest JAR file from the [releases page](https://github.com/Rayzr522/jPuzzle/releases) and run it. That's all.
